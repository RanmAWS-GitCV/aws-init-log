# ☁️ AWS Init Log

This repo documents the earliest stages of my AWS Cloud learning journey — starting at 14, with the goal of building a valid, professional cloud engineering portfolio by 18.

This is not a polished project repo — it's a changelog, note archive, and honest log of my real-time learning.
