📚 **Topics Covered:** 
- 🖥️ **AWS Management Console**: Web-based user interface for managing AWS services
- ⚙️ **AWS Service Console**: Dedicated dashboards for specific services within the AWS Console
- 🆔 **AWS Account ID & ARN (Amazon Resource Name)**:
  - Account ID identifies your AWS account uniquely
  - ARN is a unique identifier for AWS resources across all accounts
- 💻 **AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**: Command line tool for managing AWS services and resources
- 🔧 **AWS SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: Libraries in multiple programming languages to interact programmatically with AWS services (e.g., Boto3 for Python)
- 🌐 **AWS CloudShell**: Browser-based shell environment preconfigured with AWS tools, no local setup required
- 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
  - Defining and managing infrastructure using code rather than manual processes
  - Enables version control, repeatability, and automation
- 📜 **AWS CloudFormation**: AWS’s native IaC service using JSON/YAML templates to provision and manage resources
- 🛠️ **AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)**: Higher-level IaC framework allowing you to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages (Python, TypeScript, etc.)

🧠 **Key Takeaways:**
- Mastery of AWS CLI and SDKs is essential for automation and efficient cloud management
- IaC is the foundation for scalable, reliable, and auditable cloud infrastructure deployment
- Tools like CDK modernize IaC by making infrastructure definitions more expressive and developer-friendly
