## Summary

- **What is EC2?**  
  EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides scalable virtual servers (instances) to run applications in the cloud.

- **Why use EC2?**  
  Offers flexibility, control, and scalability for compute resources, similar to owning a server — but on-demand.

## Key Concepts Learned

### 🛠️ Instance Basics
- Virtual machine running on AWS.
- You choose an **AMI (Amazon Machine Image)** and **instance type**.
- Popular instance type for CCP: `t2.micro` (Free Tier eligible).

### 📦 AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
- Pre-configured OS and software.
- Can choose Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, Windows, etc.

### 🧩 Instance Types
- Defines vCPU, RAM, storage, etc.
- Types: General Purpose, Compute Optimized, Memory Optimized, etc.

### 🌍 Key Pair
- SSH access uses a public/private key pair.
- Private key stored locally (e.g., `.pem` file), used to connect securely.

### 🔐 Security Groups
- Act as a virtual firewall for the instance.
- Define allowed **inbound** and **outbound** traffic (e.g., allow SSH on port 22, HTTP on port 80).

### 🌎 Elastic IP
- Static IP address for an EC2 instance.
- Useful when IP consistency is needed (e.g., for a public-facing app).

### ⚡ EC2 Pricing Options
- **On-Demand** – Pay per hour/second. No commitment.
- **Reserved Instances** – 1-3 year contract for steady usage. Cost-effective.
- **Spot Instances** – Up to 90% cheaper, but can be interrupted anytime.
